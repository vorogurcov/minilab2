## Installation and Configuration
The app was tested using Python 3.9.13 and packages from requirements.txt

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.9.13**
2. **pip** package manager
3. **FastAPI and dependencies** installed (see below)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vorogurcov/minilab2
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Create virtual environment inside backend folder:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    py -m venv venv
    ```
    
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the main.py from the root of the project:
    ```bash
    cd .. #if you are in backend folder
    py backend/main.py
    ```

## Application Logic

1. **Unsplash API Integration**:
   - The `GET /random` endpoint fetches a random photo from Unsplash using the `/photos/random` endpoint of Unsplash's API.
   - The `GET /photos` endpoint retrieves a page of photos from Unsplash's `/photos` endpoint.
   - Both endpoints use the `client_id` as authentication, which must be provided as an environment variable (`UNSPLASH_API_TOKEN`).

2. **Joke API Integration**:
   - The `GET /random` endpoint interacts with the Official Joke API to fetch a random joke.

## Postman Workspace

A Postman workspace has been created to demonstrate the API functionality. It includes the following:

1. Pre-configured environment variables:
    - `{{base_url}}` for the local server URL.
    - `{{unsplash_api_token}}` for the Unsplash API token.

2. Requests for each endpoint:
    - `GET /random` (Unsplash)
    - `GET /photos` (Unsplash)
    - `GET /random` (Jokes)
